# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing.

## Ways to contribute

- Report bugs with clear reproduction steps.
- Suggest features and improvements.
- Submit pull requests for fixes, tests, and documentation.

## Before you start

- For larger changes, open an issue first so we can align on scope.
- Keep changes focused and avoid unrelated refactors in the same PR.

## Development workflow

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes with clear, descriptive commits.
3. Update docs/examples when behavior changes.
4. Add or update tests when applicable.
5. Run the repo's validation commands before opening a PR.

## Pull request checklist

- Include a clear summary of what changed and why.
- Link related issues.
- Describe how the change was validated (commands run, sample output, screenshots).
- Confirm no secrets, credentials, or private data were committed.

## Security and secrets

- Never commit credentials, tokens, or private keys.
- Use local `.env` files, repository secrets, or secret managers.
